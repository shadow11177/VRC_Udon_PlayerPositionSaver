# VRC_Udon_PlayerPositionSaver
Saves the position of a player in your world so if they leave for whatever reason and they come back they are at the same position where they left in. 
For example in a sleeping world so that if they chrash or have a disconnect at night they are still with their friends. 
Or in a club just to take that little anoyance of running back to your spot.
Saving interval and the length of time the position is used instead of spawn are configurable.


## To setup
- Import the Package into your Project
- Drag the Prefab into the root of your scene
- modify the two variables to your liking
